## Summary of the Document

The document outlines a two-part challenge focused on stock price prediction and system design. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### **Part 1: Stock Price Prediction Challenge**
- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to predict a stock's closing price 5 trading days into the future using historical stock price data.
- **Key Requirements**:
  1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data.
  2. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from the time series data.
  3. **Model Development**: Train a prediction model.
  4. **Model Evaluation**: Use statistical metrics (e.g., RMSE) and simulated trading performance to evaluate the model.
  5. **Documentation**: Present the approach, feature importance, and model limitations.
  
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - **EDA (50%)**: Quality of visualizations and insights.
  - **Prediction Accuracy (10%)**: Measured by RMSE and directional accuracy.
  - **Documentation and Insights (30%)**: Clear explanation of the approach, findings, and limitations.
  - **Limitation Analysis (20%)**: Identify model/data limitations and propose improvements.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Well-documented code showing the complete workflow.
  2. **EDA Report**: Visualizations, trend analysis, and feature selection justification.
  3. **Model Selection Documentation**: Comparison of models, evaluation metrics, and final model justification.
  4. **CSV File**: Predictions for the test period.
  5. **README File**: Summary of the approach, key findings, and instructions to reproduce results.

### **Part 2: End-to-End System Design**
- **Objective**: Design a production-ready system for continuous stock price prediction and insight delivery.
- **Components to Address**:
  1. **Data Collection & Ingestion**: How to source and ingest market data and additional features.
  2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Preprocessing, feature engineering, and storage architecture.
  3. **Model Operations**: Model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
  4. **Insight Delivery**: How to present predictions and insights to end-users (e.g., analysts, brokers).
  5. **System Considerations**: Scalability, reliability, latency, and cost.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. **System Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of the proposed system.
  2. **Component Justification**: Explanation of technology choices and tradeoffs.
  3. **Data Flow Explanation**: Description of data flow, batch vs. streaming decisions, and transformation stages.
  4. **Challenge Analysis**: Identify 3-5 potential challenges and propose mitigation strategies.

- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - **Completeness of Solution (25%)**: Addresses all required components.
  - **Technical Feasibility (25%)**: Realistic design given current technologies.
  - **Design Justification (30%)**: Clear reasoning for architectural choices.
  - **Challenge Awareness (20%)**: Identification of implementation hurdles and thoughtful solutions.

### **Note to Participants**
- The challenge is open-ended, and there is no single "correct" answer. Participants are evaluated on their ability to:
  - Design practical systems that solve real business problems.
  - Make informed technology choices with clear justifications.
  - Think critically about implementation challenges.
  - Communicate technical concepts effectively.

## Key Takeaways
- **Part 1** focuses on building a predictive model for stock prices, with an emphasis on EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- **Part 2** extends the challenge to designing a scalable, production-ready system for continuous prediction and insight delivery.
- The evaluation criteria emphasize both technical skills (e.g., model accuracy, system design) and soft skills (e.g., documentation, communication, and critical thinking).
- Participants are encouraged to think creatively and propose realistic solutions, considering tradeoffs and potential challenges.
